/**
 * Marker interface to indicate no auto setting of parameters.

 * <p>
 * This marker interface should be implemented by actions that do not want any
 * request parameters set on them automatically (by the ParametersInterceptor).
 * This may be useful if one is using the action tag and want to supply
 * the parameters to the action manually using the param tag.
 * It may also be useful if one for security reasons wants to make sure that
 * parameters cannot be set by malicious users.
