/**
 * <!-- START SNIPPET: javadoc -->
 * <p>
 * This annotation defines how actions can modify the namespace
 * that they are added to. This overrides the behavior of the
 * Convention plugin which by default uses the package names for
 * namespaces. Since XWork packages are created by the Convention
 * plugin via the Java packages that the actions exist in, there
 * is some tricky handling of XWork parent packages and namespaces
 * of the XWork packages for the Convention plugin discovered
 * actions so that two actions in the same package can specify
 * different parents and namespaces without collision.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In order to handle this correctly, the name of the XWork
 * package that actions are placed into is built using this
 * format:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;java-package&gt;#&lt;parent-xwork-package&gt;#&lt;namespace&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This mechanism will guarantee that two actions in the same
 * Java package can specify different parent packages (using the
 * {@link org.apache.struts2.convention.annotation.ParentPackage} annotation)
 * and namespaces (using this annotation).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The value of a Namespace annotation should specify the portion of
 * the action URL between the context path and the action name.  For
 * example:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Namespace("/careers/job-postings-overview/job-postings")
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be placed inside the special Java file
 * named <strong>package-info.java</strong>, which allows package
 * level annotations. If this is used in this manner it changes the
 * default namespace for all actions within that Java package. The
 * search order for the namespace of a particular class is therefore:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the {@link Action} annotation exists within the action and
 *  specifies a full URI (i.e. it starts with a / character)</li>
 * <li>Any Namespace annotations placed on individual action classes</li>
 * <li>Any Namespace annotations placed in the package-info.java file</li>
 * <li>The namespace as determined using the Java package name and the
 *  standard convention based naming.</li>
 * </ol>
