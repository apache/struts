/**
 * <p>
 * When a portlet is targetted for an <code>event</code>, the portlet will receive two
 * portlet requests, one for the <code>event</code> phase, and then followed by a <code>render</code>
 * operation. When in the <code>event</code> phase, the action that is executed can't render
 * any output. This means that if an action in the XWork configuration is executed in the event
 * phase, and the action is set up with a result that should render something, the result can't
 * immediately be executed. The portlet needs to "wait" to the render phase to do the
 * rendering.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When the {@link org.apache.struts2.portlet.result.PortletResult} detects such a
 * scenario, instead of executing the actual view, it prepares a couple of render parameters
 * specifying this action and the location of the view, which then will be executed in the
 * following render request.
 * </p>
